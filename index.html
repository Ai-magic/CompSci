    <h2>Why</h2>
    <div class="center">
      <button onclick="buttonPress()" class="button">Press me</button>
    </div>
    <p>This button is styled in css, written in html, but its function was programmed in JavaScript</p>
    <p>
      This button's function was made in JavaScript instead of HTML because HTML can't make any computations,
      <br>
      for it is only a structure that shows the computer how the website should be built.

    <h2>HTML Can't Do Computations</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Have you ever tried to add 2 and to in HTML? You may say that "I have, in the script tag!!!" Well in the script
      tag, you program in JavaScript. <br> HTML just says to the computer "Hey, This is JavaScript code." AKA it
      provides a structure that says inside this is JavaScript code. </p>
    <p>Programming languages have functional purposes. HTML, as a markup language doesn’t really “do” anything in the
      sense that a programming language does. <br> HTML contains no programming logic. It doesn’t have common
      conditional
      statements such as If/Else. It can’t evaluate expressions or do any math. <br> It doesn’t handle events or carry
      out
      tasks. You can’t declare variables and you can’t write functions. It doesn’t modify or manipulate data in any way.
      <br>
      HTML can’t take input and produce output. Think of it this way: you can’t compute the sum of 2 + 2 in HTML; that’s
      not what it’s for. <br> This is because HTML is not a programming language.
