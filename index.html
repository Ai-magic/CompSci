    <div class="center">
      <button onclick="buttonPress()" class="button">Press me</button>
    </div>
    <p>This button is styled in css, written in html, but its function was programmed in JavaScript (JS)</p>
    <p>
      This button's function was made in JavaScript instead of HTML because HTML can't make any computations,
      <br>
      for it is only a structure that shows the computer how the website should be built.
